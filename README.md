# ConvoBot - Smart Conversational Assistant ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

**ConvoBot** is a conversational AI built using **Streamlit** and **machine learning models** to provide real-time interactive chat experiences. It allows users to engage in dynamic conversations with AI, offering both streaming and non-streaming responses.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat Streaming**: Provides a live chat experience where responses update as the assistant is generating them.
- **Customizable Models**: Select from various machine learning models for different conversational styles.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive interface for seamless interaction.
- **Message History**: Maintains a chat history to ensure smooth interactions even across multiple sessions.
- **Custom Styling**: Tailored CSS for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive user interface.
- **Python**: Backend programming language for logic and API requests.
- **Requests**: Used for making API calls to the backend.
- **HTML/CSS**: Custom styles for the chat interface.
- **AI Models**: Various machine learning models for processing user inputs and generating responses.
